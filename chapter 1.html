She saw a rabbit figure around the back of the school ground, she a huge animal 

lover so she decided to follow it. Even though there are rules not to wonder around 

but Leah was never a kind of girl to follow rules. She followed the rabbit to the 

playground behind the school and saw a hole under the slide. She assumed that the 

rabbit must be in there, having that thought she craw into the hole without a 

second thought. As she is crawling trough a huge force pushes her in as felling 

down the hole. </p>

<p class= "big" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">‘Wow. Who knew behind the school playground has a large 

  hole in it, they really need to supervise this place. Gosh my face still hurt.’ As she
